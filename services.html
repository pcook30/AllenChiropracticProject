	<div id="ChiropracticManipulation">
        <h4>Chiropractic Manipulation:</h4>
        <p>The most common therapeutic procedure performed by doctors of chiropractic is known as "spinal manipulation," also called "chiropractic adjustment." The purpose of this is to restore joint mobility by manually applying a controlled force into joints that have become hypomobile – or restricted in their movement – as a result of a tissue injury. Tissue injury can be caused by a single traumatic event, such as improper lifting of a heavy object, or through repetitive stresses, such as sitting in an awkward position with poor spinal posture for an extended period of time. In either case, injured tissues undergo physical and chemical changes that can cause inflammation, pain, and diminished function for the sufferer. Manipulation, or adjustment, restores mobility, thereby alleviating pain and muscle tightness, and allowing tissues to heal.</p>
		  
		</div> 
	<div id="UltrasoundTherapy">
		<h4>Ultrasound Therapy:</h4>
		<p>Ultrasound therapy can be useful for many different patients. The 'micro-massage' that ultrasound creates can help reduce swelling, increase blood flow, and decrease pain, stiffness, and spasms, making it a viable therapy for numerous applications. From patients who have suffered car accidents to those that have chronic back pain from any number of sources, ultrasound therapy can help them. This ultrasound creates small sound waves that in effect vibrate and massage soft tissues and muscle. These sound waves do an excellent job in facilitating the body's healing process in addition to decreasing scar tissue formation.</p>
		  
		</div>
	<div id="ElectricalMuscleStimulation">
		<h4>Electrical Muscle Stimulation:</h4>
		<p>Electrical Muscle Stimulation is the use of a high-voltage electric stimulator to treat muscle spasms, edema of acute injury, myofascial pain and certain other disorders. It is a method of pain control by the application of electric impulses to the nerve endings. This is done through electrodes that are placed on the skin and attached to a stimulator by flexible wires. The electric impluses generated are similar to those of the body, but different enough to block transmission of pain signals to the brain. TENS is noninvasive and nonaddictive, with no side effects. <br>
		  <br>
		  This is a great therapy if there is a spasm in a back or neck muscle. It works well in relaxing the muscle and allowing it to return to its normal state rather quickly. Short therapy sessions are excellent at facilitating healing from acute and chronic pain. </p>
	</div>
	<div id="Cyrotherapy">
		<h4>Cyrotherapy:</h4>
		<p>Cryotherapy is an excellent way to help with muscle spasms in the body. This therapy is well known to help numb painful areas as well as provide a cooling relief to affected soft tissues. The therapy consists of applying cold compresses on to the skin to effectively reduce the temperature of the skin as well as constrict the blood vessels in the area. If you are suffering from a muscle spasm or just recently had a soft tissue injury, cryotherapy is an excellent way to help reduce swelling and further injury in the early stages of your healing process. This therapy is rather inexpensive and is something that can be done at home as well as in the office.</p>
		
		</div>
	<div id="XRay">
		<h4>X-Ray:</h4>
		<p>Radiographs or x-rays are used to see the bones. X-rays do not detect soft tissue abnormalities like torn ligaments or strained muscles. However, they are a valuable source of information and helps the doctor to determine important information such as misalignments of the bones, possible fractures or breaks, as well as the level of current degeneration of your joints. Along with the examination, x-rays help to determine the treatment plan and possibility of inherent risks associated with chiropractic manipulation. <br>
		  On your follow-up visit, Dr. Allen will show you your x-rays and discuss them in depth with you. He will show you your spinal alignment, areas of degeneration (if applicable), and the areas of concern for treatment. After that point, you will have the opportunity to discuss any questions or concerns about your condition with him.</p>
		
		</div>
	<div id="SubluxationTreatment">
		<h4>Subluxation Treatment:</h4>
		<p>In a pain free spine, the 24 vertebrae plus the sacrum and coccyx bone normally stack on top of one another in a centered alignment. Life experiences of all kinds impose forces of movement that often move one or more vertebrae away from this ideal, centered alignment. This misalignment of one vertebrae in relation to the next is called a subluxation. A subluxation can cause pain, because when the bones move they press on nerves that exit out holes provided by the interface between two adjacent vertebrae.So, a subluxation is the condition of adjacent spinal bones being out of alignment with respect to one another. Because nerves exit the spaces created between two adjacent vertebrae, a subluxation may cause a pinched nerve, and pain. <br>
		</p>
		<p>In more technical terms, a subluxation is "a motion segment, in which alignment, movement integrity, and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact.&quot; There are four phases of subluxation, with phase one being virtually pain free to four leaving you in grave conditions and with severe loss of mobility. Treatment through chiropractic reconstrutive care can take between 1 and 4 years depending on the phase you are in.</p>

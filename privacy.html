		  <h4 >HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices</h4>
        <p>Please review this notice carefully. It descirbes how your medical inoformation may be used and disclosed and how you may gain access to that information.</p>
        
		 <h4 >Policy Statement</h4>
        <p>This Practice is committed to maintaining the privacy of your protected health information (&ldquo;PHI&rdquo;), which includes information about your medical condition and the care and treatment you receive from the Practice and other health care providers. This Notice details how your PHI may be used and disclosed to third parties for purposes of your care, payment for your care, health care operations of the Practice, and for other purposes permitted or required by law. This Notice also details your rights regarding your PHI.</p>
		  
        <h4 >Use or Disclosure of PHI</h4>
        <p>The Practice may use and/or disclose your PHI for purposes related to your care, payment for your care, and health care operations of the Practice. The following are examples of the types of uses and/or disclosures of your PHI that may occur. These examples are not meant to include all possible types of use and/or disclosure.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Care</strong> – In order to provide care to you, the Practice will provide your PHI to those health care professionals directly involved in your care so they may understand your medical condition and needs and provide advice or treatment. For example, your physician may need to know how your condition is responding to the treatment provided by the Practice.</li>
          <li><strong>Payment</strong> – In order to get paid for some or all of the health care provided by the Practice, the Practice may provide your PHI, directly or through a billing service, to appropriate third party payers, pursuant to their billing and payment requirements. For example, the Practice may need to provide your health insurance carrier with information about health care services you received from the Practice so the Practice may be properly reimbursed.</li>
          <li><strong>Health Care Operations</strong> – In order for the Practice to operate in accordance with applicable law and insurance requirements and in order for the Practice to provide quality and efficient care, it may be necessary for the Practice to compile, use and/or disclose your PHI. For example, the Practice may use your PHI in order to evaluate the performance of the Practice&rsquo;s personnel in providing care to you.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Note: Genetic information is protected by law and is not considered part of Health Care Operations.</strong></li>
          
          <li><strong>Fundraising</strong> – To the extent that the Practice engages in fundraising activities (i.e. appeals for money, help, or event sponsorships), certain types of PHI may be disclosed for these purposes, unless you specifically &lsquo;opt out&rsquo; of receiving notification. To &lsquo;opt out&rsquo;, call or email the Practice to be excluded from fundraising campaigns.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Practice may use and/or disclose your PHI, without a written Authorization from you, in the following instances:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>De-identified Information</strong> – Your PHI is altered so that it does not identify you and, even without your name, cannot be used to identify you.</li>
          <li><strong>Business Associate</strong> – To a business associate, who is someone the Practice contracts with to provide a service necessary for your treatment, payment for your treatment and/or health care operations (e.g., billing service or transcription service). The Practice will obtain satisfactory written assurance, in accordance with applicable law, that the business associate and their subcontractors will appropriately safeguard your PHI.</li>
          <li><strong>Personal Representative</strong> – To a person who, under applicable law, has the authority to represent you in making decisions related to your health care.</li>
          <li><strong>Public Health Activities</strong> – Such activities include, for example, information collected by a public health authority, as authorized by law, to prevent or control disease, injury or disability. This includes reports of child abuse or neglect.</li>
          <li><strong>Federal Drug Administration</strong> – If required by the Food and Drug Administration to report adverse events, product defects, problems, biological product deviations, or to track products, enable product recalls, repairs or replacements, or to conduct post marketing surveillance.</li>
          <li><strong>Abuse, Neglect or Domestic Violence</strong> – To a government authority, if the Practice is required by law to make such disclosure. If the Practice is authorized by law to make such a disclosure, it will do so if it believes the disclosure is necessary to prevent serious harm or if the Practice believes you have been the victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence. Any such disclosure will be made in accordance with the requirements of law, which may also involve notice to you of the disclosure.</li>
          <li><strong>Health Oversight Activities</strong> – Such activities, which must be required by law, involve government agencies involved in oversight activities that relate to the health care system, government benefit programs, government regulatory programs and civil rights law. Those activities include, for example, criminal investigations, audits, disciplinary actions, or general oversight activities relating to the commmunity&rsquo;s health care system.</li>
          <li><strong>Family and Friends</strong> - Unless expressly prohibited by you, the Practice may disclose PHI to a member of your family, a relative, a close friend or any other person you identify, as it directly relates to that person&rsquo;s involvement in your health care.

          <li><strong>Research</strong> – If the Practice is involved in research activities, your PHI may be used, but such use is subject to numerous governmental requirements intended to protect the privacy of your PHI such as approval of the research by an institutional review board, the de-identification of your PHI before it is used, and the requirement that protocols must be followed. Individuals have the option to &lsquo;opt out&rsquo; of certain types of research activities.</li>
          <li><strong>Avert a Threat to Health or Safety</strong> – The Practice may disclose your PHI if it believes that such disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public and the disclosure is to an individual who is reasonably able to prevent or lessen the threat.</li>

          <li><strong>Marketing</strong> - Face to face communication directly with the patient, treatment and coordination of care activities, refill reminders or communications about drugs that have already been prescribed, or promotional gifts of nominal value do not require authorization as long as the Practice receives no financial remuneration for making the communication. All other situations require separate authorization.</li>
          <li><strong>Required by Law</strong> – If otherwise required by law, but such use or disclosure will be made in compliance with the law and limited to the requirements of the law.</li>
        </ol>

If you disagree with the Practice&rsquo;s denial, you have the right to submit a written statement of disagreement.</li>

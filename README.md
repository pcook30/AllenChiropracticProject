# AllenChiropracticProject
Web development project for Kennesaw State University

For this project, my team and I were tasked with updating the website of a local chiropractor, Dr. Allen. He felt his outdated website could result in a loss of clients. I designed a template and new logo for my team to utilize in our update and split the webpages evenly between the group members for transfering information and/or editing unnecessary information. 

The original Allen chiropractic website can be found here: https://allenchiropractictoday.com
